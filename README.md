Developed a Python-based weather application that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app provides temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for any city entered by the user. Implemented with a clean Tkinter GUI (or CLI if you used command-line), featuring error handling for invalid inputs and dynamic updates.
